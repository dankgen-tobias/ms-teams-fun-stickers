What is a messaging extension? https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/messaging-extensions/what-are-messaging-extensions?tabs=dotnet

Code in repo is based on this tutorial: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/sbs-gs-msgext?tabs=vscode%2Cvsc%2Cvcode%2Cviscode

The initial commit of this repo is the setup as it was automatically created by VSCode. The second commit then includes the changes to make a rough
prototype of custom stickers working.

How to setup app: Either follow tutorial linked above or read [bot/README.md](bot/README.md)

Please keep in mind that this is for demonstrating purposes only. I just changed the code of the tutorial a little bit to see if custom stickers are even possible.
If one wants to do this properly, it would propably better to setup an app from ground up and not use the tutorial template. Also, node.js is not the only supported language, maybe
it is easier to work with something else.
